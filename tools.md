Every tool that I use, I try to find the binary (zip - non installable) version of each program.

- [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Basic and advanced conversion of video and audio files.
- [AltSnap](https://github.com/RamonUnch/AltSnap) - Allows to drag, resize and snap windows without grabing the title bar
- [PowerToys](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp89dcgq3k6vld?hl=en-us&gl=US) - A lot of useful tools, I use the most Always on top, Text extractor and PowerToys Run.
- [Tabby](https://tabby.sh/) - Remote shell app (moved from Termius)
- [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) - SFTP file transfering
- [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) - use ISOs without burning to flashdrive
- [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) - burning ISO and IMG files onto drives
- [VSTHost](https://www.hermannseib.com/english/vsthost.htm) - Used for live effects for microphone
- [Google Quick Share](https://www.android.com/better-together/quick-share-app/) - Like Air-Drop but for Android-Windows.

Tootls that I used to use but are still cool

- [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php) - Transfering files to remote servers using SSH.
- [RBTray](https://github.com/benbuck/rbtray) - Hiding windows to tray, so the apps which do not have that option by default, do not clutter the task bar. (useful for next tool)
- [Termius](https://termius.com/) - Remote shell and SFTP
