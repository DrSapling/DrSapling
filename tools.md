Every tool that I use, I try to find the binary (zip - non installable) version of each program.
-
- [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Basic and advanced conversion of video and audio files.
- [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) - use ISOs wihtout having to use the next tool
- [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) - burning in ISO and IMG files onto drives. (used when  using ventoy is not possible)
- [RBTray](https://github.com/benbuck/rbtray) - Hiding windows to tray, so the apps which do not have that option by default, do not clutter the task bar. (useful for next tool)
- [VSTHost](https://www.hermannseib.com/english/vsthost.htm) - Used for live effects for microphone.
- [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php) - Transfering files to remote servers using SSH.
